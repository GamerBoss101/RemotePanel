# MCSS control panel


## DISCLAIMER: This is an early version of the project and may not be stable

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### We offer a [hosted panel](https://mcss.fast.moe/) for you to use, but if you want to host your own version you will find all the code you need here. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### To get started all you need is something that can serve html and javascript (a webserver works too)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Feel free to report any issues [here.](https://github.com/stefmmm/MCSS-Panel/issues)


### If you want to follow future development and features, checkout [the trello board.](https://trello.com/b/AuA0MAIU/mcss-panel)
